notice of motion to authorize national finance committee to study estimates
notice of motion to authorize committee to permit electronic coverage
notice of motion to authorize committee to engage services
cost overruns in capital expenditures on embassies abroad
he is from alberta
an albertan more efficient than a manitoban
i do not think so
they are fairly simple questions
the land is vacant
that is a lot of money in india
they have been doing this kind of thing for years
perhaps the leader of the government would care to respond
hon j bernard boudreau leader of the government
honourable senators i thank the honourable senator for his remarks
answer the speech please
the honourable senator raises concerns with respect to the vacant land
we have these outrageous overruns
how are you addressing this problem
how will you prevent it in the future
the honourable senator raises an important issue
appropriate level of reserve in employment insurance fund
hon donald h oliver
hon j bernard boudreau leader of the government
i believe they are acting if i may say this conservatively
what does the minister consider to be an adequate reserve
when can employers look forward to some relief
what is an appropriate level of reserve
other factors may be brought to bear
as the auditor general reported
the figure is startling
hon j bernard boudreau leader of the government
honourable senators 13 billion or 90 percent is hardly some
that is a new definition of some i must say
you will be there
i may be there
we will be there too
will you be there
i will be there
honourable senators i understand more people may be seeking a nomination
it is an example i am not sure i would recommend
honourable senators the honourable senator has clearly expressed her concerns
auditor general s report problems of underestimating budget surplus
hon j bernard boudreau leader of the government
one can ascribe whatever motives one chooses
upon hearing those remarks i marvel at how times have changed
auditor general s report implementation of defence ethics program
hon michael a meighen
this program was a cornerstone of the government s somalia inquiry
hon j bernard boudreau leader of the government
delay in building new war museum protection of archived art treasures
hon norman k atkins
hon j bernard boudreau leader of the government
the matter that the honourable senator raises is a serious one
new war museum nature of private financing
what kind of private financing was the minister talking about
hon j bernard boudreau leader of the government
business of the senate
the hon the speaker pro tempore
honourable senators the time allowed for question period is up
is there leave to continue honourable senators
hon dan hays deputy leader of the government
delayed answer to oral question
hon dan hays deputy leader of the government
possibility of further assistance to protect people against violence
ccjs also publishes reports on overall criminal justice trends
an options paper is presently under development
courts have been imposing stiff sentences for this type of crime
orders of the day
civil international space station agreement implementation bill
hon william m kelly
the iss has no direct military role or capability
this guarantees the iss is used for exclusively peaceful purposes
how far we have come
we have sent probes to the outer reaches of space
the hon the speaker
is it your pleasure honourable senators to adopt the motion
motion agreed to and bill read second time
the hon the speaker
honourable senators when shall this bill be read a third time
hon anne c cools
honourable senators i rise to speak to bill s 7
the constitution act 1867 section 17 states
bill s 7 poses an important and pressing constitutional question
the statute of westminster stated in part
it is simply too inconvenient for ministers to attend
nor is this veto of the english monarch an empty form
royal assent is no mere formality
this alteration is a limitation
however for a private member the situation is quite different
that could have the makings of a constitutional crisis
i believe that committee was chaired by senator gildas molgat
the report s recommendation no 3 said at page 1469
the operative words are address and praying that she approve
this intimation should be given before the committal of the bill
hon anne c cools
hon eymard g corbin
i have never done that
are you demeaning the rest of us
those words were not my words
this bill has its supporters as it certainly has its opponents
that is exactly what i am doing at this moment
she made me feel very receptive to her point of view
nevertheless we must choose our words carefully
in fact i think it diminishes the entire debate
hon john lynch staunton leader of the opposition
honourable senators i rise on a point of order
i believe that this motion goes way beyond the bill
therefore i ask that the speaker rule it out of order
hon dan hays deputy leader of the government
if it is i will so move
the hon the speaker
honourable senators a point of order has been raised
from my interpretation there is no violation whatsoever of the prerogative
hon noel a kinsella deputy leader of the opposition
we have a series of safeguards built into the house procedures
rule 2 of the rules of the senate reads
hon anne c cools
honourable senators i should like to respond
my amendment is a good amendment
the question before us right now is a point of order
these are matters that should be left to the whole chamber
my amendment is clear on the face of it
i have given my copy of it to senator lynch staunton
these issues have been debated quite extensively
for the time being i will quote lord lansdowne
honourable senators the royal consent is the assent in advance
i do not think anyone will dispute that
in the instance of the royal recommendation it is more difficult
the hon the speaker
no one in this chamber would dare challenge it
that is not for us
it is a constitutional requirement which we respect
the hon the speaker
if not i will take the matter under advisement
debate adjourned to await speaker s ruling
legal and constitutional affairs
committee authorized to meet during sitting of the senate
leave having been given to proceed to motions
hon lorna milne pursuant to notice of november 25 1999 moved
the hon the speaker
is it your pleasure honourable senators to adopt the motion
hon john lynch staunton leader of the opposition
it is as simple as that
i sympathize with senator milne
that was the agreement at the time
this system is not working
hon dan hays deputy leader of the government
i do not disagree with him
in fact i understand his point very well
the hon the speaker
is it your pleasure honourable senators to adopt the motion
banking trade and commerce
committee authorized to meet during sitting of the senate
hon leo e kolber
the hon the speaker
is leave granted honourable senators
the hon the speaker
is it your pleasure honourable senators to adopt the motion
energy the environment and natural resources
the hon the speaker
i move the amended motion standing in my name
the hon the speaker
unfortunately we could not improve bill c 32
we faced closure twice in committee and here in the senate
frankly part of what they suggested just cannot be done
how is that feasible
for those still in use the minister has two choices
for that reason alone several substances have not been regulated
which will it be
first the committee in the other place has a full slate
this is harmful to all canadians but especially to northerners
in fact it has contradictory meanings in our two official languages
it excludes the metis from a new national advisory committee
i hope that the bill will be redrafted for the better
however that did not happen and is now past history
hon dan hays deputy leader of the government
would the honourable senator spivak accept a question
is this something that the committee has discussed
is that the case with respect to this matter
we are talking about beginning a review
the last review took five years
perhaps the proper thing is to have someone adjourn the debate
on motion of senator taylor debate adjourned
business of the senate
hon eymard g corbin
the intention is behind those words
the hon the speaker
the honourable senator has done so today
the hon the speaker
the honourable senator cools objects
the hon the speaker
the hon the speaker
this is a proper point of order
i undertake to do so
energy the environment and natural resources
