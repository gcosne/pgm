\subsection{HMM-based alignment models}

The HMM-based alignment models were introduced by \textit{Vogel and al.} and aim at modeling the joint probability of a French sentence $\textbf{f}$, of length $J$ and an alignment $\textbf{a}\in \{1,\dots,I\}^J$, given a English sentence $\textbf{e}$ of length $I$.
Without, loss of generality, this probability can be expressed as (chain-rule and independance of $\textbf{f}$ and $\textbf{a}$):
\begin{align*}
Pr(\textbf{f},\textbf{a}|\textbf{e}) &= Pr(f_0,a_0|\textbf{e}) \prod_{j=1}^J Pr(f_j,a_j|f_{1}^{j-1},a_{1}^{j-1},\textbf{e})\\
&= Pr(f_0|\textbf{e}) \cdot Pr(a_0|\textbf{e})\\
&\cdot \prod_{j=1}^J Pr(f_j|f_{1}^{j-1},a_{1}^{j-1},\textbf{e}) Pr(a_j|f_{1}^{j-1},a_{1}^{j-1},\textbf{e})
\end{align*}

The HMM model reduced the generality of the previous formula by assuming first-order dependance of alignments and translation probability of French word at position $j$ to be only dependent on the English word at position $a_j$, thus yielding the HMM model:

\begin{align*}
Pr(\textbf{f},\textbf{a}|\textbf{e}) &= p(f_0|e_{a_0}) p(a_0)\\
&\cdot \prod_{j=1}^J p(f_j|e_{a_{j}}) \cdot p(a_j|a_{j-1},I)
\end{align*}

Figure~\ref{fig:hmm} presents the graphical model associated with HMM-based alignement models. What can be noticed is that, in this context, each sentence pair represents a Hidden Markov Model which parameters are shared with all other sentences of the corpus.
The \textbf{parameters for the HMM model} are
\begin{align*}
\Theta &= \lbrace\\
& p(i) &\mbox{   the initial alignment probabilities ($p(a_0)$)}\\ 
& p(i|i',I) &\mbox{   the transition matrix}\\
& p(f|e) &\mbox{   the emission (translation) probabilities}\rbrace
\end{align*}

A further assumption from \textit{Vogel and al.} is that alignment transition probabilities \textbf{only depend on relative positions}: $p(i|i',I) = p(i'-i|I)$

Just as for the IBM models, the observations are the sequences of French words in French sentences, while the alignments (and thus the corresponding English words) act as hidden variables. A way to solve this problem is to use an \textbf{EM principle}.
The \textbf{Expectation step} consists in computing alignment unary and binary probabilities in each sentence pair $(\textbf{f},\textbf{e})$. 

\begin{align*}
\gamma_i(j) &= p(a_j=i|\textbf{f})\\
\xi_{k,l}(j) &= p(a_j=k,a_{j+1}=l|\textbf{f})
\end{align*}

This can be performed using the Forward-Backward algorithm.
The \textbf{Maximisation step} consists in re-estimating the model's parameters according to the previously computed probabilities.

The \textbf{Viterbi} algorithm is then used to retrieve the most likely alignements in the corpus, according to the computed transition and emission probabilities.
